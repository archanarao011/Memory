## Project Description
This is my first project in Python, and I have attempted to develop a Memory game to test our memory skills.
Good memory is always one of the qualities we need to have, and this simple game is an all-time brain training for kids and adults alike which is why I chose this project.

## Rules
1. Turn over any two cards.
2. If the two cards match, they remain face up.
3. If not, they are flipped face down.
4. The game is over when all the cards have been matched.
5. Press ESC or close button to exit.

## Workflow
Outline the workflow you used in your project. What are the steps you went through?
1.Analyzed and designed the game by preparing a flowchart.
2.Identified the challenges to be focused on.
3.Created a Trello board using the template provided.
4.Created a GIT repository with a README and gitignore file and cloned.
5.Developed and tested the game for any bugs or errors.
6.Prepared the project presentation.


## Organization
I have used a basic Trello board to help myself organize the work to categorize my tasks to To-Do’s, In-progress and Done.
This repository has the following files:
1.README.md
2.gitignore
3.main.ipynb
4..jpg files (the image files to be loaded on the board)
